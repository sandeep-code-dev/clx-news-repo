Like many girls her age, she loves to keep up with the latest fashion
trends and explore new ways to express herself. Shopping is fun, but
it won’t always be this way.

I remember once being that teen girl shopping in the women’s section
for the first time. I took stacks upon stacks of jeans with me to the
dressing room, searching in vain for that one pair that fit perfectly.
Over 20 years later, my hunt for the ideal pair of jeans continues.
But now as an adult, I’m stuck with the countless ways that women’s
apparel is not made for the average person, like me.

Children’s clothing sizes are often tied to a kid’s age or stage of
development. The idea is that as a young person grows older, her
clothes will evolve with her. Youth styles tend to be boxy and
oversized to allow room for kids to move and grow. By early
adolescence, apparel for girls becomes more fitted. Junior’s styles
have higher waistlines and less-pronounced curves compared to adult
clothing lines. In short: clothes for tweens are made for tween
bodies.

By the time most teenage girls can wear women’s clothes - around age 15 -
their options are seemingly endless. But the evolution in clothing
sizes that followed girls throughout childhood abruptly stops there.

This is the reality I find myself reckoning with today: Women’s
clothing - designed for adults - fits modern teen girls better.

■ Painis universal sizingisnot

Few life experiences feel as universal, across generations, as the
pains and frustrations of trying to find clothes that fit.

Sizes vary wildly from store to store. Even within a single apparel
company, no one size is consistent. There are no regulations or
universal sizing standards. Instead each brand is incentivized to make
up its own. When size guides change - and they’re always changing -
brands are not obligated to disclose updates.

There are also often different sizing structures for every type of
garment. “Plus” size means one thing, “curve” means another, and
“extended” sizes can be defined as all of the above or something else
entirely. Don’t count on any of those sizes to be available to try on
in-store, but do brace for return fees if your online order doesn’t
fit. Free in-store alterations are largely a thing of the past, while a
trip to the tailor’s can cost just as much as the item itself.

The only consistent feature is that the industry at large continues to
cling onto the same underlying sizing system that’s been broken for
decades. And it’s only gotten worse.

On top of all these problems, consumers often know the labels for any
given size cannot be trusted.

Vanity sizing, the practice where size labels stay the same even as
the underlying measurements frequently become larger, is so ubiquitous
across the fashion and apparel industry that younger generations have
never experienced a world without it.

Cultural narratives around vanity sizing often square the blame on
female shoppers, not brands. Newsweek once called it “self-delusion on
a mass scale” because women were more likely to buy items that were
labeled as sizes smaller than reality. But there’s more to the story.

Vanity sizing provides a powerful marketing strategy for brands.
Companies found that whenever women needed a size larger than
expected, they were less likely to follow through on their purchases.
Some could even develop negative associations with the brand and never
shop there again. But when manufacturers manipulated sizing labels,
leading to a more positive customer experience, brands could maintain
a slight competitive edge.

The dynamic perpetuates an arms race toward artificially deflating
size labels. Most shoppers aren’t even aware when size charts change,
or by how much. If anything, vanity sizing consistently gaslights
women to the point where few are able to know their “true” size. But
where would we be today without it?

■ sew what?

I once believed that change was inevitable and sizing problems would
become a relic of the past. If it wasn’t some scrappy upstart that
promised to revolutionize the sizing system, then at least the major
fashion conglomerates would be well-placed to modernize and tap the
full potential of the plus-size market. But that progress never fully
materialized. And I got tired of waiting.

A few years ago, I started learning how to sew. Somehow it felt more
practical to make my own clothes than count on meaningful change to
happen on its own. Getting started was easier than I thought. The
first sewing pattern I ever completed - a boxy, drop-shoulder style that
could turn into either a shirt or dress - was free to download. It
included a 29-page instruction manual with photos and illustrations
documenting every step.

Drafting a custom pattern based on my body measurements and
proportions

From there, I started learning how to draft my own sewing patterns
from scratch. That’s when I realized the truth behind my sizing
struggles: Clothing sizes are optimized for mass production and appeal -
not women’s bodies. Nothing represents this more than a size 8.

Fashion designers often use body measurements for a size 8 as a
starting point when creating new design samples. Manufacturers then
use a mathematical formula to determine each next size up or down the
range in a process called grading. The effect is like a Russian doll.
Each size up is incrementally larger than the last.

The uniform shape makes it easier for factories to mass-produce
garments, however it comes with several tradeoffs. It’s hard to scale
up to larger-sized clothing before the proportions become distorted. It
also becomes impractical to make multiple versions of a single item to
accommodate varying body shapes or heights. That means most women’s
clothing is derived from a single set of proportions - a size 8.
According to U.S. health data, fewer than 10% of adult women have
waistlines that fit the standard sample size or smaller.

I, like the vast majority of women, do not fit the standard mold.
Instead I took an old pattern-making textbook often taught in fashion
design schools to start making clothes to fit my own unique
proportions. I gathered and recorded over 58 different body
measurements in order to get started and from there, I could make my
own custom base pattern, known as a bodice block or sloper.

Once I compared my personalized sloper to commercial patterns and
retail garments, I had a revelation: clothes were never made to fit
bodies like mine. It didn’t matter how much weight I gained or lost,
whether I contorted my body or tried to buy my way into styles that
“flatter” my silhouette, there was no chance that clothes would ever
fit perfectly on their own. Finally I understood why.

■ sizingfor every body

The fashion industry thrives on exclusivity. Luxury brands maintain
their status by limiting who is able to buy or even wear their
clothes. If few women fit the “ideal” standards, then products serving
only them are inherently exclusionary. Size charts become the de facto
dividing line determining who belongs and who doesn’t.

This line of gatekeeping is baked into the foundation of virtually all
clothing. The modern sizing system in the U.S. was developed in the
1940s based on mostly young, white women. No women of color were
originally included. The system was never built to include a diverse
cross-section of people, ages, or body types. It has largely stayed
that way by design.

In its 1995 standards update, ASTM International admitted that its
sizing guidelines were never meant to represent the population at
large. Instead body measurements were based on “designer experience”
and “market observations.” The goal was to tailor sizes to the
existing customer base. But what happens when more than half of all
women are pushed to the margins or left behind?

It doesn’t have to be this way. Teenage girls shouldn’t be aging out
of sizing options from the moment they start wearing women’s clothes.
A woman does not need hourglass proportions to look good, just as
garment-makers do not need standardized sizes to produce well-fitting
clothes.

There are no rules forcing brands to adopt any particular sizing
system. There is no such thing as a “true” size 8, or any size for
that matter. If brands are constantly developing and customizing their
size charts, then it makes little sense to perpetuate a broken system.
Sizes are all made up anyway - why can’t we make them better?

Methodology

To highlight the median body proportions of the adult women in the
U.S., we relied on anthropometric reference data for children and
adults that is regularly released by the National Center for Health
Statistics within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

For this story, we pulled data on the median waistline circumference
of women and girls that was gathered between 2021-2023. For girls and
women under 20 years old, measurements were recorded in two-year age
ranges (ex: 10-11 years, 14-15 years), with a median of 141 participants
per age range. For women over 20, measurements were recorded in nine-
year age ranges (ex: 20-29 years, 30-39 years) and collectively for all
women 20 and older. Each nine-year age range had a median of 465
participants. Overall, measurements were recorded for 3,121 women ages
20 and older. Those who were pregnant were excluded from the data.

HHS also provides a breakdown of measurements within set percentiles
for each age range, which includes figures for the 5th, 10th, 15th,
25th, 50th, 75th, 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles. We then used that
percentile data to extrapolate the waistline measurements of all women
and girls within each respective age group.

We also compared figures to those recorded by HHS from 1988-1994.
There, 7,410 women ages 20 and older participated in the study.
Measurements were originally recorded in centimeters, so we converted
to inches.

Brands included in the size chart comparisons represent a diverse
cross-section of popular apparel brands and retailers in the U.S.,
including a mix of mass market, fast fashion, premium and luxury
labels.

For each brand, we focused on collecting body measurements for
“regular” or “standard” size ranges, as well as “plus” sizes when
available. Sizing information for “petite,” “tall,” or “curve”
clothing lines were not included. Size charts reflect the body
measurements for garments categorized as general “apparel.” In a
select few cases where that category was unavailable, “dresses” were
used as the default garment type.

Within each size range, we focused on collecting three main body
measurements: Bust, waist, and hip. Some were presented as a range
from minimum to maximum values, while others were single measurements.
All numeric U.S. women’s sizing labels and descriptions were recorded,
as well as their corresponding alpha sizes, when available.

Size chart data was last manually captured in July 2025 and may not
reflect a brand’s current size chart. Brands frequently change their
size charts, and more often than not, shoppers aren’t even aware when
measurements or sizes are updated.

The standardized size charts refer to ASTM International’s regular
release of its Standard Table of Measurements for Adult Female Misses
Figure Type. The 1995 release (designated as D 5585-95) reflects sizes
2-20. ASTM updated its standards in 2021 (designated as D5585-21) to
include sizes 00-20.
