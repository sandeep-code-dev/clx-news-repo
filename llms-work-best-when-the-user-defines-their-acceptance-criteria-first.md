  One of the simplest tests you can run on a database:

  Doing a primary key lookup on 100 rows.

  SQLite takes 0.09 ms. An LLM-generated Rust rewrite takes 1,815.43 ms.

  It’s not a misplaced comma! The rewrite is 20,171 times slower on one
  of the most basic database operations.

  EDIT: Several readers have confused this project with Turso/libsql.
  They are unrelated. Turso forks the original C SQLite codebase; the
  project analyzed here is a ground-up LLM-generated rewrite by a single
  developer. Running the same benchmark against Turso shows performance
  within 1.2x of SQLite consistent with a mature fork, not a
  reimplementation.

  The thing is though: The code compiles. It passes all its tests. It
  reads and writes the correct SQLite file format. Its README claims
  MVCC concurrent writers, file compatibility, and a drop-in C API. On
  first glance it reads like a working database engine.

  But it is not!

  LLMs optimize for plausibility over correctness. In this case,
  plausible is about 20,000 times slower than correct.

  I write this as a practitioner, not as a critic. After more than 10
  years of professional dev work, I’ve spent the past 6 months
  integrating LLMs into my daily workflow across multiple projects. LLMs
  have made it possible for anyone with curiosity and ingenuity to bring
  their ideas to life quickly, and I really like that! But the number of
  screenshots of silently wrong output, confidently broken logic, and
  correct-looking code that fails under scrutiny I have amassed on my
  disk shows that things are not always as they seem. My conclusion is
  that LLMs work best when the user defines their acceptance criteria
  before the first line of code is generated.

  A note on the projects examined: this is not a criticism of any
  individual developer. I do not know the author personally. I have
  nothing against them. I’ve chosen the projects because they are
  public, representative, and relatively easy to benchmark. The failure
  patterns I found are produced by the tools, not the author. Evidence
  from METR’s randomized study and GitClear’s large-scale repository
  analysis support that these issues are not isolated to one developer
  when output is not heavily verified. That’s the point I’m trying to
  make!

  This article talks about what that gap looks like in practice: the
  code, the benchmarks, another case study to see if the pattern is
  accidental, and external research confirming it is not an outlier.

  I compiled the same C benchmark program against two libraries: system
  SQLite and the Rust reimplementation’s C API library. Same compiler
  flags, same WAL mode, same table schema, same queries. 100 rows:

      ●●● Image 

  I’ll take the TRANSACTION batch row as the baseline because it doesn’t
  have the same glaring bugs as the others, namely no WHERE clauses and
  per-statement syncs. In this run that baseline is already 298x, which
  means even the best-case path is far behind SQLite. Anything above 298x
  signals a bug.

  The largest gap beyond our baseline is driven by two bugs:

  INSERT without a transaction: 1,857x versus 298x in batch mode. SELECT
  BY ID: 20,171x. UPDATE and DELETE are both above 2,800x. The pattern
  is consistent: any operation that requires the database to find
  something is insanely slow.

  I read the source code. Well.. the parts I needed to read based on my
  benchmark results. The reimplementation is not small: 576,000 lines of
  Rust code across 625 files. There is a parser, a planner, a VDBE
  bytecode engine, a B-tree, a pager, a WAL. The modules have all the
  “correct” names. The architecture also looks correct. But two bugs in
  the code and a group of smaller issues compound:

  In SQLite, when you declare a table as:

    CREATE TABLE test (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, value REAL);

  the column id becomes an alias for the internal rowid - the B-tree key
  itself. A query like WHERE id = 5 resolves to a direct B-tree search
  and scales O(log n). (I already wrote a TLDR piece about how B-trees
  work here.) The SQLite query planner documentation states: “the time
  required to look up the desired row is proportional to logN rather
  than being proportional to N as in a full table scan.” This is not an
  optimization. It is a fundamental design decision in SQLite’s query
  optimizer:

    # `where.c`, in `whereScanInit()`
    if( iColumn==pIdx->pTable->iPKey ){
        iColumn = XN_ROWID;
    }

  The line above converts a named column reference to XN_ROWID when it
  matches the table’s INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column. The VDBE then triggers
  a SeekRowid operation instead of a full table scan, which makes the
  whole thing proportional to logN.

  The Rust reimplementation has a proper B-tree. The table_seek function
  implements correct binary search descent through its nodes and scales
  O(log n). It works. But the query planner never calls it for named
  columns!

  The is_rowid_ref() function only recognizes three magic strings:

    fn is_rowid_ref(col_ref: &ColumnRef) -> bool {
        let name = col_ref.column.to_ascii_lowercase();
        name == "rowid" || name == "_rowid_" || name == "oid"
    }

  A column declared as id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, even though it is
  internally flagged as is_ipk: true, doesn’t get recognized. It is
  never consulted when choosing between a B-tree search and a full table
  scan.

  Every WHERE id = N query flows through codegen_select_full_scan(),
  which emits linear walks through every row via Rewind / Next / Ne to
  compare each rowid against the target. At 100 rows with 100 lookups,
  that is 10,000 row comparisons instead of roughly 700 B-tree steps.
  O(n²) instead of O(n log n). This is consistent with the ~20,000x
  result in this run.

  Every WHERE clause on every column does a full table scan. The only
  fast path is WHERE rowid = ? using the literal pseudo-column name.

  The second bug is responsible for the 1,857x on INSERT. Every bare
  INSERT outside a transaction is wrapped in a full autocommit cycle:
  ensure_autocommit_txn() → execute → resolve_autocommit_txn(). The
  commit calls wal.sync(), which calls Rust’s fsync(2) wrapper. 100
  INSERTs means 100 fsyncs.

  SQLite does the same autocommit, but uses fdatasync(2) on Linux, which
  skips syncing file metadata when compiled with HAVE_FDATASYNC (the
  default). This is roughly 1.6 to 2.7 times cheaper on NVMe SSDs.
  SQLite’s per-statement overhead is also minimal: no schema reload, no
  AST clone, no VDBE recompile. The Rust reimplementation does all three
  on every call.

  Looking at the Rust TRANSACTION batch row, batched inserts (one fsync
  for 100 inserts) take 32.81 ms, whereas individual inserts (100 fsync
  calls) take 2,562.99 ms. That’s a 78x overhead from the autocommit.

  These two bugs are not isolated cases. They are amplified by a group
  of individually defensible “safe” choices that compound:

    - AST clone on every cache hit. The SQL parse is cached, but the AST
      is .clone()‘d on every sqlite3_exec(), then recompiled to VDBE
      bytecode from scratch. SQLite’s sqlite3_prepare_v2() just returns
      a reusable handle.
    - 4KB (Vec<u8>) heap allocation on every read. The page cache
      returns data via .to_vec(), which creates a new allocation and
      copies it into the Vec even on cache hits. SQLite returns a direct
      pointer into pinned cache memory, creating zero copies. The Fjall
      database team measured this exact anti-pattern at 44% of runtime
      before building a custom ByteView type to eliminate it.
    - Schema reload on every autocommit cycle. After each statement
      commits, the next statement sees the bumped commit counter and
      calls reload_memdb_from_pager(), walks the sqlite_master B-tree
      and then re-parses every CREATE TABLE to rebuild the entire
      in-memory schema. SQLite checks the schema cookie and only reloads
      it on change.
    - Eager formatting in the hot path. statement_sql.to_string()
      (AST-to-SQL formatting) is evaluated on every call before its
      guard check. This means it does serialization regardless of
      whether a subscriber is active or not.
    - New objects on every statement. A new SimpleTransaction, a new
      VdbeProgram, a new MemDatabase, and a new VdbeEngine are allocated
      and destroyed per statement. SQLite reuses all of these across
      the connection lifecycle via a lookaside allocator to eliminate
      malloc/ free in the execution loop.

  Each of these was probably chosen individually with sound general
  reasoning: “We clone because Rust ownership makes shared references
  complex.” “We use sync_all because it is the safe default.” “We
  allocate per page because returning references from a cache requires
  unsafe.”

  Every decision sounds like choosing safety. But the end result is
  about 2,900x slower in this benchmark. A database’s hot path is the
  one place where you probably shouldn’t choose safety over performance.
  SQLite is not primarily fast because it is written in C. Well.. that
  too, but it is fast because 26 years of profiling have identified
  which tradeoffs matter.

  In the 1980 Turing Award lecture Tony Hoare said: “There are two ways
  of constructing a software design: one way is to make it so simple
  that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other is to make it
  so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.” This LLM-
  generated code falls into the second category. The reimplementation is
  576,000 lines of Rust (measured via scc, counting code only, without
  comments or blanks). That is 3.7x more code than SQLite. And yet it
  still misses the is_ipk check that handles the selection of the
  correct search operation.

  Steven Skiena writes in The Algorithm Design Manual: “Reasonable-
  looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Algorithm correctness is a
  property that must be carefully demonstrated.” It’s not enough that
  the code looks right. It’s not enough that the tests pass. You have to
  demonstrate with benchmarks and with proof that the system does what
  it should. 576,000 lines and no benchmark. That is not “correctness
  first, optimization later.” That is no correctness at all.

  The SQLite reimplementation is not the only example. A second project
  by the same author shows the same dynamic in a different domain.

  The developer’s LLM agents compile Rust projects continuously, filling
  disks with build artifacts. Rust’s target/ directories consume 2-4 GB
  each with incremental compilation and debuginfo, a top-three complaint
  in the annual Rust survey. This is amplified by the projects
  themselves: a sibling agent-coordination tool in the same portfolio
  pulls in 846 dependencies and 393,000 lines of Rust. For context,
  ripgrep has 61; sudo-rs was deliberately reduced from 135 to 3.
  Properly architected projects are lean.

  The solution to the disk pressure: a cleanup daemon. 82,000 lines of
  Rust, 192 dependencies, a 36,000-line terminal dashboard with seven
  screens and a fuzzy-search command palette, a Bayesian scoring engine
  with posterior probability calculations, an EWMA forecaster with PID
  controller, and an asset download pipeline with mirror URLs and
  offline bundle support.

  To solve this problem:

    */5 * * * * find ~/*/target -type d -name "incremental" -mtime +7 -exec rm -rf {} +

  A one-line cron job with 0 dependencies. The project’s README claims
  machines “become unresponsive” when disks fill. It does not once
  mention Rust’s standard tool for exactly this problem: cargo-sweep. It
  also fails to consider that operating systems already carry ballast
  helpers. ext4’s 5% root reservation, reserves blocks for privileged
  processes by default: on a 500 GB disk, 25 GB remain available to root
  even when non-root users see “disk full.” That does not guarantee zero
  impact, but it usually means privileged recovery paths remain
  available so root can still log in and delete files.

  The pattern is the same as the SQLite rewrite. The code matches the
  intent: “Build a sophisticated disk management system” produces a
  sophisticated disk management system. It has dashboards, algorithms,
  forecasters. But the problem of deleting old build artifacts is
  already solved. The LLM generated what was described, not what was
  needed.

  THIS is the failure mode. Not broken syntax or missing semicolons. The
  code is syntactically and semantically correct. It does what was asked
  for. It just does not do what the situation requires. In the SQLite
  case, the intent was “implement a query planner” and the result is a
  query planner that plans every query as a full table scan. In the disk
  daemon case, the intent was “manage disk space intelligently” and the
  result is 82,000 lines of intelligence applied to a problem that needs
  none. Both projects fulfill the prompt. Neither solves the problem.

  The obvious counterargument is “skill issue, a better engineer would
  have caught the full table scan.” And that’s true. That’s exactly the
  point! LLMs are dangerous to people least equipped to verify their
  output. If you have the skills to catch the is_ipk bug in your query
  planner, the LLM saves you time. If you don’t, you have no way to know
  the code is wrong. It compiles, it passes tests, and the LLM will
  happily tell you that it looks great.

  The tools used to measure LLM output reinforce the illusion. scc‘s
  COCOMO model estimates the rewrite at $21.4 million in development
  cost. The same model values print("hello world") at $19.

      ●●● Image 

  COCOMO was designed to estimate effort for human teams writing
  original code. Applied to LLM output, it mistakes volume for value.
  Still these numbers are often presented as proof of productivity.

      ●●● Image 

  The metric is not measuring what most think it is measuring.

  Now 2 case studies are not proof. I hear you! When two projects from
  the same methodology show the same gap, the next step is to test
  whether similar effects appear in the broader population. The studies
  below use mixed methods to reduce our single-sample bias.

  This gap between intent and correctness has a name. AI alignment
  research calls it sycophancy, which describes the tendency of LLMs to
  produce outputs that match what the user wants to hear rather than
  what they need to hear.

  Anthropic’s “Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models”
  (ICLR 2024) paper showed that five state-of-the-art AI assistants
  exhibited sycophantic behavior across a number of different tasks.
  When a response matched a user’s expectation, it was more likely to be
  preferred by human evaluators. The models trained on this feedback
  learned to reward agreement over correctness.

  The BrokenMath benchmark (NeurIPS 2025 Math-AI Workshop) tested this in
  formal reasoning across 504 samples. Even GPT-5 produced sycophantic
  “proofs” of false theorems 29% of the time when the user implied the
  statement was true. The model generates a convincing but false proof
  because the user signaled that the conclusion should be positive. GPT-5
  is not an early model. It’s also the least sycophantic in the
  BrokenMath table. The problem is structural to RLHF: preference data
  contains an agreement bias. Reward models learn to score agreeable
  outputs higher, and optimization widens the gap. Base models before
  RLHF were reported in one analysis to show no measurable sycophancy
  across tested sizes. Only after fine-tuning did sycophancy enter the
  chat. (literally)

  In April 2025, OpenAI rolled back a GPT-4o update that had made the
  model more sycophantic. It was flabbergasted by a business idea
  described as “shit on a stick” and endorsed stopping psychiatric
  medication. An additional reward signal based on thumbs-up/thumbs-down
  data “weakened the influence of […] primary reward signal, which had
  been holding sycophancy in check.”

  In the context of coding, sycophancy manifests as what Addy Osmani
  described in his 2026 AI coding workflow: agents that don’t push back
  with “Are you sure?” or “Have you considered…?” but instead provide
  enthusiasm towards whatever the user described, even when the
  description was incomplete or contradictory.

  This also applies to LLM-generated evaluation. Ask the same LLM to
  review the code it generated and it will tell you the architecture is
  sound, the module boundaries clean and the error handling is thorough.
  It will sometimes even praise the test coverage. It will not notice
  that every query does a full table scan if not asked for. The same
  RLHF reward that makes the model generate what you want to hear makes
  it evaluate what you want to hear. You should not rely on the tool
  alone to audit itself. It has the same bias as a reviewer as it has as
  an author.

  An LLM prompted to “implement SQLite in Rust” will generate code that
  looks like an implementation of SQLite in Rust. It will have the right
  module structure and function names. But it can not magically generate
  the performance invariants that exist because someone profiled a real
  workload and found the bottleneck. The Mercury benchmark (NeurIPS
  2024) confirmed this empirically: leading code LLMs achieve ~65% on
  correctness but under 50% when efficiency is also required.

  The SQLite documentation says INTEGER PRIMARY KEY lookups are fast. It
  does not say how to build a query planner that makes them fast. Those
  details live in 26 years of commit history that only exists because
  real users hit real performance walls.

  Now 2 case studies are not proof. I hear you! When two projects from
  the same methodology show the same gap, the next step is to test
  whether similar effects appear in the broader population. The studies
  below use mixed methods to reduce our single-sample bias.

  The question becomes whether similar effects show up in broader
  datasets. Recent studies suggest they do, though effect sizes vary.

  In February 2025, Andrej Karpathy tweeted: “There’s a new kind of
  coding I call ‘vibe coding’, where you fully give in to the vibes,
  embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.”

  Karpathy probably meant it for throwaway weekend projects (who am I to
  judge what he means anyway), but it feels like the industry heard
  something else. Simon Willison drew the line more clearly: “I won’t
  commit any code to my repository if I couldn’t explain exactly what it
  does to somebody else.” Willison treats LLMs as “an over-confident pair
  programming assistant” that makes mistakes “sometimes subtle,
  sometimes huge” with complete confidence.

  The data on what happens when that line is not drawn:

  METR’s randomized controlled trial (July 2025; updated February 24,
  2026) with 16 experienced open-source developers found that
  participants using AI were 19% slower, not faster. Developers expected
  AI to speed them up, and after the measured slowdown had already
  occurred, they still believed AI had sped them up by 20%. These were
  not junior developers but experienced open-source maintainers. If even
  THEY could not tell in this setup, subjective impressions alone are
  probably not a reliable performance measure.

  GitClear’s analysis of 211 million changed lines (2020-2024) reported
  that copy-pasted code increased while refactoring declined. For the
  first time ever, copy-pasted lines exceeded refactored lines.

  The implications are no longer just a “fear”. In July 2025, Replit’s
  AI agent deleted a production database containing data for 1,200+
  executives, then fabricated 4,000 fictional users to mask the
  deletion.

  Google’s DORA 2024 report reported that every 25% increase in AI
  adoption at the team level was associated with an estimated 7.2%
  decrease in delivery stability.

  SQLite shows what correct looks like and why the gap is so hard to
  close.

  SQLite is ~156,000 lines of C. Its own documentation places it among
  the top five most deployed software modules of any type, with an
  estimated one trillion active databases worldwide. It has 100% branch
  coverage and 100% MC/DC (Modified Condition/Decision Coverage the
  standard required for Level A aviation software under DO-178C). Its
  test suite is 590 times larger than the library. MC/DC does not just
  check that every branch is covered. but proves that every individual
  expression independently affects the outcome. That’s the difference
  between “the tests pass” and “the tests prove correctness.” The
  reimplementation has neither metric.

  The speed comes from deliberate decisions:

  Zero-copy page cache. The pcache returns direct pointers into pinned
  memory. No copies. Production Rust databases have solved this too.
  sled uses inline-or-Arc-backed IVec buffers, Fjall built a custom
  ByteView type, redb wrote a user-space page cache in ~565 lines. The
  .to_vec() anti-pattern is known and documented. The reimplementation
  used it anyway.

  Prepared statement reuse. sqlite3_prepare_v2() compiles once.
  sqlite3_step() / sqlite3_reset() reuse the compiled code. The cost of
  SQL-to-bytecode compilation cancels out to near zero. The
  reimplementation recompiles on every call.

  Schema cookie check. uses one integer at a specific offset in the file
  header to read it and compare it. The reimplementation walks the
  entire sqlite_master B-tree and re-parses every CREATE TABLE statement
  after every autocommit.

  fdatasyncinstead of fsync. Data-only sync wihtout metadata journaling
  saves measurable time per commit. The reimplementation uses sync_all()
  because it is the safe default.

  The iPKeycheck. One line in where.c. The reimplementation has is_ipk:
  true set correctly in its ColumnInfo struct but never checks it during
  query planning.

  Competence is not writing 576,000 lines. A database persists (and
  processes) data. That is all it does. And it must do it reliably at
  scale. The difference between O(log n) and O(n) on the most common
  access pattern is not an optimization detail, it is the performance
  invariant that helps the system work at 10,000, 100,000 or even
  1,000,000 or more rows instead of collapsing. Knowing that this
  invariant lives in one line of code, and knowing which line, is what
  competence means. It is knowing that fdatasync exists and that the
  safe default is not always the right default.

  The is_rowid_ref() function is 4 lines of Rust. It checks three
  strings. But it misses the most important case: the named INTEGER
  PRIMARY KEY column that every SQLite tutorial uses and every
  application depends on.

  That check exists in SQLite because someone, probably Richard Hipp 20
  years ago, profiled a real workload, noticed that named primary key
  columns were not hitting the B-tree search path, and wrote one line in
  where.c to fix it. The line is not fancy. It doesn’t appear in any API
  documentation. But no LLM trained on documentation and Stack Overflow
  answers will magically know about it.

  That’s the gap! Not between C and Rust (or any other language). Not
  between old and new. But between systems that were built by people who
  measured, and systems that were built by tools that pattern-match. LLMs
  produce plausible architecture. They do not produce all the critical
  details.

  If you are using LLMs to write code (which in 2026 probably most of us
  are), the question is not whether the output compiles. It is whether
  you could find the bug yourself. Prompting with “find all bugs and fix
  them” won’t work. This is not a syntax error. It is a semantic bug:
  the wrong algorithm and the wrong syscall. If you prompted the code
  and cannot explain why it chose a full table scan over a B-tree search,
  you do not have a tool. The code is not yours until you understand it
  well enough to break it.

  LLMs are useful. They make for a very productive flow when the person
  using them knows what correct looks like. An experienced database
  engineer using an LLM to scaffold a B-tree would have caught the is_ipk
  bug in code review because they know what a query plan should emit. An
  experienced ops engineer would never have accepted 82,000 lines
  instead of a cron job one-liner. The tool is at its best when the
  developer can define the acceptance criteria as specific, measurable
  conditions that help distinguish working from broken. Using the LLM to
  generate the solution in this case can be faster while also being
  correct. Without those criteria, you are not programming but merely
  generating tokens and hoping.

  The vibes are not enough. Define what correct means. Then measure.

  Stay safe out there!
