  Though he died too young, Carl Sagan left behind an impressively large
  body of work, including more than 600 scientific papers and more than
  20 books. Of those books, none is more widely known to the public - or,
  still, more widely read by the public - than Cosmos, accompanied as it
  was by Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, a companion television series on
  PBS. Sagan’s other popular books, like Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors
  or Contact (the basis of the 1997 Hollywood movie) are also well
  worth reading, but we perhaps ignore at our greatest peril The Demon-
  Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark. Published in 1995, the
  year before Sagan’s death, it stands as his testament to the
  importance of critical, scientific thinking for all of us.

  The Demon-Haunted Worldis the subject of the Genetically Modified
  Skeptic video above, whose host Drew McCoy describes it as his
  favorite book. He pays special attention to its chapter in which Sagan
  lays out what he calls his “baloney detection kit.” This assembled
  metaphorical box of tools for diagnosing fraudulent arguments and
  constructing reasoned ones involves these nine principles:

    - Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the “
      facts.”
    - Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable
      proponents of all points of view.
    - Arguments from authority carry little weight - “authorities” have
      made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future.
      Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no
      authorities; at most, there are experts.
    - Spin more than one hypothesis. If there’s something to be
      explained, think of all the different ways in which it could be
      explained. Then think of tests by which you might systematically
      disprove each of the alternatives.
    - Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s
      yours. It’s only a way station in the pursuit of knowledge. Ask
      yourself why you like the idea. Compare it fairly with the
      alternatives.
    - See if you can find reasons for rejecting it. If you don’t, others
      will.
    - If whatever it is you’re explaining has some measure, some
      numerical quantity attached to it, you’ll be much better able to
      discriminate among competing hypotheses. What is vague and
      qualitative is open to many explanations.
    - If there’s a chain of argument, every link in the chain must work
      (including the premise) - not just most of them.
    - Occam’s Razor. This convenient rule-of-thumb urges us when faced
      with two hypotheses that explain the data equally well to choose
      the simpler. Always ask whether the hypothesis can be, at least in
      principle, falsified…. You must be able to check assertions out.
      Inveterate skeptics must be given the chance to follow your
      reasoning, to duplicate your experiments and see if they get the
      same result.

  As McCoy points out, these techniques of mind have to do with
  canceling out the manifold biases present in our thinking, those
  natural human tendencies that incline us to accept ideas that may or
  may not coincide with reality as it is. If we take no trouble to
  correct for these biases, Sagan came to believe, we’ll become easy
  marks for all the tricksters and charlatans who happen to come our
  way. And that’s just on the micro level: on the macro level,
  vulnerability to delusion can bring down entire civilizations.

  “Like all tools, the baloney detection kit can be misused, applied out
  of context, or even employed as a rote alternative to thinking,” Sagan
  cautions. “But applied judiciously, it can make all the difference in
  the world - not least in evaluating our own arguments before we present
  them to others.” McCoy urges us to heed these words, adding that “this
  kit is not some perfect solution to the world’s problems, but as it’s
  been utilized over the last few centuries” - for its basic precepts
  long predate Sagan’s particular articulation - “it has enabled us to
  create technological innovations and useful explanatory models of our
  world more quickly and effectively than ever before.” The walls of
  baloney may always be closing in on humanity, but if you follow
  Sagan’s advice, you can at least give yourself some breathing room.
